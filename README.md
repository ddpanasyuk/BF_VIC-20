# BF_VIC-20
Simple brainfuck interpreter written for the Commodore VIC-20. Done for a quick primer on 6502 ASM before another project. Tape size for programs and cells is limited to 0xFF bytes. BF programs are entered key by key through the keyboard and terminated with the '!' character. BF symbols '[' and ']' are replaced with '(' and ')' for faster program input on the VIC-20 keyboard.

To run this program on a VIC-20, either type out the BASIC code in 'load.bas' on the VIC-20 BASIC prompt screen, or compile it as a .prg to load into the VIC-20 memory from a cassette or floppy drive emulator.
